👋🏾I’m Aayush, and I lead the [Design System](https://paste.twilio.design) team at Twilio. I'm a former Product Designer, Journalist, and some other things in between. At my day job, I focus on building better products through design, and better design through systems.

Before founding the Design System, I also lead design efforts on the Twilio Serverless platform and Developer Experience. My main focus was on Studio, a visual programming language that allows for a low-code, drag & drop interface to Twilio's APIs.

I'm presently _not_ looking for work. 

Day job aside, I run a few experiments in the domains of water justice, criminal justice, and sex worker rights. I care about helping people be their best selves, and being an ally to marginalized voices. I live in Oakland, CA with my two dogs: Thrace & Tribbles.
