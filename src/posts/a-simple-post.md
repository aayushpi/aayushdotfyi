## Slow down, do it again.

Intentional work and operation is hard: chasing one distraction after another until exhaustion is an easy way to live: one that's determined by interruptions, familiarity, and the lack of a challenge. Instead, I hope to slow down, and give myself the time to actually do the thing I want to do.

## Don't forget to celebrate the effort.

It's so easy to finish something, set sights on a new target and go forward. Conversely, sitting down with something: be it a great success or a miss and appreciating it for what it was is incredibly hard. I hope to look at the work I've done with fondness, rest the critical eye for a minute, and appreciate what it's taken to get there.

## Make every act a training tool for the future.

While this is closely related to the work that I do, it applies to a lot more: by making learning the base outcome of any effort, its easy to decide if an action is worth undertaking, or if it would be better off systemized or sponsored. Systemize what's obvious, so you can work on the harder, more interesting problems. Sponsor what's achievable, so others may benefit from growth that you've already experienced.

## Operate inside ambiguity.

I do this already, but doubling down on this is an exciting way to live: so much so that I already have this tattooed on my arm. By choosing to operate in a less defined domain, I ensure that I'm constantly learning,  not operating in autopilot, and recognizing impermanence and imperfection.
