I’m Aayush (ah-you-shh) Iyer.

I’m working at Twilio, and focus on building better products through design, and better design through systems. Day job aside, I run a few experiments in spaces I care about, and read a lot. I care about helping people be their best selves, and being an ally to marginalized voices. I live in Oakland, CA with my two dogs: Thrace & Tribbles.
